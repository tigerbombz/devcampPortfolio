My updated Portfolio using Ruby on Rails 5.2

This web application showcases advanced knowledge and skill of RoR by implementing numerous gems to create a unique experience for myself and any user that wants to explore the website. From a sophisticated login system to beautiful designs to out of this world Javascript, I have done it all. Feel free to register and contribute to my Blog to test out any feature. 

If you want to use this, Fork the repo and feel free to customize and use it at your own will. Once downloaded run `bundle install` to get all the packages so nothing is broken. 

To test in development make sure to run the rails server and do all your changes in development. Then create your own instance on Heroku if you want to deploy. 

Enjoy!
